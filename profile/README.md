# Imagiaura Discord Bot
Imagiaura is a discord bot focused on providing high quality image generation, and multiple AI tools for free, in the form of a easy-to-use discord bot.

The bot is free, however user's will be required to skip ad's in form of "Link Shorteners" to earn GenTokens.
GenTokens can be used to purchase generations, and the AD's (along with the optional real-life purchases) allow us to keep the bot free for free user's, while providing high quality features to paid subscribers and at a cost of certain ammount of GenTokens to free user's.

## Current Available Txt-TO-Img Models
- FLUX.1 Schnell ~8-15s
